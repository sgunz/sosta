\title{sosta: A package for the analysis of anatomical tissue structures in spatial omics data}
\description{
`sosta` (Spatial Omics STructure Analysis) is a package for analyzing spatial omics data to explore tissue organization at the anatomical structure level. It reconstructs morphologically relevant structures based on molecular features or cell types. It further calculates a range of structural and shape metrics to quantitatively describe tissue architecture. The package is designed to integrate with other packages for the analysis of spatial (omics) data.
